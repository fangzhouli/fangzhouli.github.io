Hi, I'm Fangzhou (Fang) Li! I am a fourth-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of California, Davis, and a graduate student researcher at [Tagkopoulos Lab](http://tagkopouloslab.ucdavis.edu/) and [AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems](https://aifs.ucdavis.edu/). I have bachelor's degrees of computer science and applied mathematics.

## My Research
I focus on applying machine learning techniques to various life science problemes, finding a path to improve human health. I am specialzed in deep learning, natural language processing, and knowledge graph construction. My current projects include constructing knowledge graph for foods, data-driven precise nutrition, and accelerating drug development.
