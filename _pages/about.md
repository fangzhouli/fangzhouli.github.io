I'm Fangzhou (Fang) Li, a 3rd-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of California, Davis, and a graduate student researcher at [Tagkopoulos Lab](http://tagkopouloslab.ucdavis.edu/) and [AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems](https://aifs.ucdavis.edu/). I have bachelor's degrees of computer science and applied mathematics.

## My Research
I focus on understanding the “nutritional dark matter”-the great number of chemicals commonly found in foods yet with unknown health effects-using machine learning methods. I utilize deep learning, natural language processing, and interpretable machine learning techniques.

## More About Me
My hobby is mixed martial arts, in which I learn techniques from boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, and Brazilian jujitsu. I speak both Mandarin and Japanese natively!
