Hi, I'm Fangzhou (Fang) Li! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the University of California, Davis, and a graduate student researcher at [Tagkopoulos Lab](http://tagkopouloslab.ucdavis.edu/) and [AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems](https://aifs.ucdavis.edu/).

## My Research
I focus on applying AI techniques to biological data, synthesizing knowledge useful for optimizing human health. I specialze in machine/deep learning, natural language processing, and knowledge graphs. My current projects include food knowledge graph construction, data-driven precise nutrition, and drug development acceleration.

## More About Me
My hobby is doing combat sports. I have 2+ years of experience in mixed martial arts (MMA), and my daily training routine rotates among MMA, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and boxing.

I can speak Mandarin and Japanese natively.
